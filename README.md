## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS Notation
- Javascript ES6

### What I learned

I was able to try using BEM Notation for CSS and it definitely made the code cleaner and easier to understand. I've also tried the PerfectPixel Extension for Google Chrome to get the site as close as possible to the design.
